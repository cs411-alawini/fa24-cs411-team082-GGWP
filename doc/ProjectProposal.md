# Project Title - TraversAll

## Project Summary
Whether you're an international or domestic traveller, finding the right recreational activity in the United States can be a daunting task, with the wide variety and range of activities available. Even for locals, finding the right activities to do with friends that fits everyone's criteria can be a frustrating feat. To remedy this, our project, _TraversAll_ aims to bridge the gap between online information and individual preferences in recreation. By collating important information in an accessible and easy to navigate manner, we strive to encourage users to explore a more diverse range of activities while whether on the other side of the country, in their state or just in their own local community. 

## Description
Our system will take in user input from both selection and search properties to suggest the most suitable recreational activities based on indvidiual needs and interests such as location(US state), average time needed, popular times, activity type, accessibility, etc. By minimizing the period of time spent searching on multiple platforms for various activity types, our system can help people of all ages and situations to find their needed recreation type for both personal and work situations as well as for those who require additional accomodations.

## Creative Component
Reminisce Your Trip - 
To keep a beautiful visual tracker of every place you've visited, when you move a place from your 'bucket list' to your 'completed' list, a map of the United States only visible to you will be updated with a pin of the location and the option to add a small message recapping your adventure.

Share With The World - 
To share your memories with other travellers, you can click on a map of the United States accessible to everybody, and add a short written message reminiscing your experiences along with a pin designating the place you've visited.
Therefore, not only can you keep track of your own pins and memories, you can also gain insight from others and their experiences to help plan your next trip!

Integrate with your Calendar - 
Add activities and locations to your calendar as events to streamline trip planning and coordination with friends through Google Calendar API.

## Usefulness
Simple features - TraversAll allows users to filter and search through locations and activities to find those that meet their criteria and save activities in a 'bucket list'.

Complex features - TraversAll users can also save locations, add activities to their calendar, add their experiences to a map of the US.

Similar websites/applications with their differences and/or shortcomings we hope to overcome:
- Recreation.gov - lists only camping and cabins related plans
- Meetup - does not account for those with accessibility needs
- TripAdvisor - too focussed on selling experiences to users and has an issue with fake reviews, we hope to provide unbiased and factual information

## Realness
- Museums, Aquariums, Zoos - Kaggle (33072 rows, 25 columns)
- National Parks - Kaggle (63 rows, 8 columns)
- US States - Scraped from Wikipedia (50 rows, 3 columns)

## Functionality
- Add activities with basic information such as type, location, cost, accessibility
- Search for activities based on type, location, time
