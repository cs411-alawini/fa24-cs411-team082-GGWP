# Project Title

## Project Summary
Whether you're an international or domestic traveller, finding the right recreational activity in the United States can be a daunting task, with the wide variety and range of activities available. Even for locals, finding the right activities to do with friends that fits everyone's criteria can be a frustrating feat. To remedy this, our project aims to bridge the gap between online information and individual preferences in recreation. By collating important information in an accessible and easy to navigate manner, we strive to encourage users to explore a more diverse range of activities while whether on the other side of the country, in their state or just in their own local community. 

## Description
Our system will take in user input from both selection and search properties to suggest the most suitable recreational activities based on indvidiual needs and interests such as location(US state), average time needed, popular times, activity type, accessibility, etc. By minimizing the period of time spent searching on multiple platforms for various activity types, our system can help people of all ages and situations to find their needed recreation type for both personal and work situations as well as for those who require additional accomodations.

## Creative Component


## Usefulness
Explain as clearly as possible why your chosen application is useful. What are the basic functions of your web application? (What can users of this website do? Which simple and complex features are there?). Make sure to answer the following questions: Are there any similar websites/applications out there?  If so, what are they, and how is yours different?
Users of this website can create their own account, find and save activties they find interest in. Simple features include search and filtering properties, complex feature may include some calendar-related connection to planning activities.

Similar websites/applications with their differences and/or shortcomings we hope to overcome:
- Recreation.gov - lists only camping and cabins related plans
- Meetup - does not account for those with accessibility needs

## Realness
Describe your data sources (Where is the data from? In what format [csv, xls, txt,...], data size [cardinality and degree], what information does the data source capture?). 
- Museums - Kaggle
- Zoos - Web Scraped Wikipedia
- Skiing Slopes
- National Parks
- US States

## Functionality
- Create user reviews and ratings, new activity pop-ups
- Delete activities that are no longer available
- Update wait times, activity information
- Search for activities based on type, location, time
- Triggers with discounts for students and veterans, altered results for accomodations

## Low-fidelity UI Mockup 
What do you imagine your final applicationâ€™s interface might look like? A PowerPoint slide or a pencil sketch on a piece of paper works!

## Project Work distribution
Who will be responsible for each of the tasks or subtasks?
Explain how backend systems will be distributed across members. Be as specific as possible as this could be part of the final peer evaluation metrics.
