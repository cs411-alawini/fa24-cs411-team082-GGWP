## Project Summary
Whether it be international or domestic travel, finding recreational activties in the United States can be a daunting task with the wide variety and range of activities available. Even for locals, it can be hard to find activities to do with visiting friends or just casual get-togethers with others locally. To remedy this shortcoming, our project aims to aid in that process by bridging the gap between online information and individual experience in recreation. By making such activities more accessible, we hope to encourage users to explore diverse activities while traveling but also in their local areas.
